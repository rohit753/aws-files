Test::File::ShareDir

"Test::File::ShareDir" is some low level plumbing to enable a
distribution to perform tests while consuming its own "share"
directories in a manner similar to how they will be once installed.

This allows "File::ShareDir" to see the *latest* version of content
instead of simply whatever is installed on whichever target system you
happen to be testing on.

Note: This module only has support for creating 'new' style share dirs
and are NOT compatible with old File::ShareDirs.

For this reason, unless you have File::ShareDir 1.00 or later installed,
this module will not be usable by you.
