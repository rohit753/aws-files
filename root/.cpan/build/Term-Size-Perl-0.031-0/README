Term::Size::Perl is a Perl module which provides a straightforward 
way to get the size of the terminal (or window) on which 
a script is running.

After building/installing, this module does it job 
with pure Perl code, via ioctl() builtin. The trick is to
extract at build time some configuration parameters
via compiling/running a C code which gets the needed
information for driving Perl ioctl() in the specific
machine.
