  Seven of my perls hang with it in 03_child.t, so we skip this test here

match:
  distribution: '^MLEHMANN/AnyEvent-3.4.tar.gz'
test:
  args:
    - TEST_FILES=t/0[0124]*.t
  env:
    PERL_ANYEVENT_VERBOSE: 2
depends:
  configure_requires:
    Event: 0
  requires:
    Event: 0

  7.05 has a resolver test that fails at my site, unrelated to AnyEvent

match:
  distribution: '^MLEHMANN/AnyEvent-7\.05'
goto: "MLEHMANN/AnyEvent-7.04.tar.gz"

  https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Attachment/1508465/809040/0001-Re-weaken-timer-references-after-sorting.patch
  https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2017/11/msg247426.html
  Patch is without a version change. I am not endorsing the patch, was
  just trying to build AnyEvent with it to see what else happens to
  AnyEvent::HTTP in the bleadperl v5.27 release cycle. Result was
  https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132527 and so I commented
  out following lines.
